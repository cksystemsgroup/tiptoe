Tiptoe Scheduler Prototype Release
=======================================================================

This package contains the source code of tiptoes' scheduler prototype
implementation.
==================================
Directory tree:
./include:  	all header files
./include/asm: 	a symbolic link set to the correct architecture
		(asm-i386, or asm-x86-64)
./include/asm-i386: 	hardware dependent header files for IA32
./include/asm-x86-64:	hardware dependent header files for AMD64
./include/utils:	header files of used utilities
./include/queues:	header files of different queues plugins

./src:		all source code files
./src/queues:	different queue implementations
./src/utils:	utilities implementation files (e.g. bitmaps)

./data:		different workload files for running the simulation
==================================
Compiling:
A makefile is supplied in the ./src/ directory.  Before starting
make set the symbolic link ./include/asm to correct architecture
of the machine.  "make" compiles all plugins and builds an
executable for each.  Possible compile flags are documented in the
supplied makefile.
==================================
Running:
All executables build during the previous step are simulations,
which expect the number of scheduler calls the simulation will run
and a workload description file as input.  By default the scheduler
actions are displayed via a simple user interface (ncurses). Examples
workload files with various number of processes are include in the
./data directory
