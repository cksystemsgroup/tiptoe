Short-term Memory for Self-collecting Mutators
-----------------------------------------------
We propose a new memory model for heap management, called short-term
memory, and concurrent implementations of short-term memory for Java
and C, called self-collecting mutators.  In short-term memory objects
on the heap expire after a finite amount of time, which makes
deallocation unnecessary.  Self-collecting mutators requires
programmer support to control the progress of time and thereby enable
reclaiming the memory of expired objects.  We informally describe a
simple translation scheme for porting existing programs to
self-collecting mutators.  As shown by our experimental results on
several benchmarks, self-collecting mutators performs competitively
with garbage-collected and explicitly managed systems.  Unlike
garbage-collected systems, self-collecting mutators does not introduce
pause times and provide constant execution time of all operations,
independent of the number of reachable objects, and constant
short-term memory consumption after a steady state has been reached.
Self-collecting mutators can be linked against any unmodified C code
introducing a per-object space overhead of one word and negligible
runtime overhead.  Short-term memory may then be used to remove
explicit deallocation of some but not necessarily all objects.


How to build libscm
--------------------
* Use a recent version of gcc. libscm is known to work with gcc 4.4.3
  on Linux x86
* run make to build the shared library
* the library resides in the dist subdirectory
* take a look at the examples subdirectory (c files and Makefile)
  to find out how to build a program using libscm.
* You can run the examples with the provided run-*.sh scripts that set up the
  environment.
